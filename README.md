# pySync
This Python script provides one-way synchronization between files from a source directory to a destination directory. It periodically checks for changes in the source directory and updates the destination directory accordingly.


## Usage
```
py sync.py <source_path> <destination_path> [-i <sync_interval>] [-l <log_file_path>] [-d]
```
